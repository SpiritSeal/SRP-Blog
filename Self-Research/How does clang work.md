**You**: I'm trying to extend clang. How would I go about doing that?

--------
**ChatGPT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>To extend Clang, you can create your own custom tool using the Clang libraries. This can be done by creating a new tool using the Clang Tooling libraries, which provide a convenient way to create new Clang-based tools. You can also create a new Clang plugin, which allows you to add new functionality to Clang at specific points in the compilation process. The Clang documentation is a good place to start for more information on how to do this.</p><p>Additionally, you can also write a new code transformation pass, which is a way to modify the code being compiled.</p><p>It's important to note that Clang is a complex piece of software and extending it may require a good understanding of C++ and the Clang codebase.</p></div>

**You**: Explain to me the clang compilation process

--------
**ChatGPT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>The Clang compilation process is a series of steps that takes source code written in a programming language and converts it into machine code that can be executed by a computer. The basic steps of the Clang compilation process are:</p><ol><li><p>Preprocessing: This step takes the source code and applies any preprocessor directives, such as #include or #define, to generate a preprocessed source file.</p></li><li><p>Compilation: The preprocessed source code is then passed to the Clang compiler, which generates assembly code for the target platform.</p></li><li><p>Assembly: The assembly code is then passed to an assembler, which converts it into machine code.</p></li><li><p>Linking: The machine code is then passed to a linker, which combines it with any libraries or object files needed to create a final executable.</p></li><li><p>Optimization: Clang also has a series of optimization passes that will run on the intermediate representation of the code, these passes will try to improve the performance of the code or reduce the size of the final binary.</p></li><li><p>Code generation: After the optimization is done, the code is then translated into the target machine code.</p></li></ol><p>It is worth noting that this is a simplified version of the Clang compilation process, and there may be additional steps depending on the specific use case and settings.</p></div>

**You**: I want to make it so that compiled code cannot write to certain directories on the filesystem. Which step of the compilation process would I need to modify in order to achieve this?

--------
**ChatGPT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>To prevent compiled code from writing to certain directories on the file system, you would need to modify the linking step of the compilation process. Specifically, you would need to add a security check in the linker that verifies that the code being linked is not trying to write to a restricted directory.</p><p>One way to do this is to add a custom linker script that checks the addresses of the output code and makes sure they do not fall within the range of the restricted directories. Another way is to use a linker plugin that can intercept the linking process and check the output code as well.</p><p>It's worth noting that this is a complex task, and you will need a good understanding of the linker's inner workings and the operating system's file system calls to accomplish this.</p><p>Additionally, it's important to note that this may not be completely secure, as a determined attacker may be able to bypass these checks. This approach should be considered as a defense-in-depth mechanism rather than a silver bullet solution.</p></div>

**You**: How would I add this security check in clang?

--------
**ChatGPT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>There are a few different ways you could add a security check in Clang to prevent compiled code from writing to certain directories on the file system, but one common approach is to create a Clang plugin.</p><p>A Clang plugin is a shared library that is loaded by Clang at runtime, and it can interact with the Clang compiler at various points in the compilation process. To create a Clang plugin, you'll need to write C++ code that uses the Clang plugin API, which allows you to create custom passes that can analyze and modify the Clang AST (abstract syntax tree) representation of the code.</p><p>You would need to create a new pass that visits the AST representation of the code and looks for file system calls that attempt to write to restricted directories, such as the <code>open</code> or <code>fopen</code> system calls. When such a call is found, you can generate an error or warning message.</p><p>It's worth noting that this is a complex task and you'll need a good understanding of Clang's internals, C++, and the operating system's file system calls to accomplish this. Additionally, it's important to remember that this may not be completely secure, as a determined attacker may be able to bypass these checks.</p><p>Another approach would be to use the Clang tooling library to create a custom tool that will perform the check on the final linked binary. This approach may be less intrusive and allow you to check the final binary in a more comprehensive way.</p></div>

**You**: Walk me through the process of creating a "Hello World" Clang plugin

--------
**ChatGPT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Creating a "Hello World" Clang plugin is a great way to get started with the Clang plugin API and understand the basic structure of a Clang plugin. Here's a general overview of the steps you would need to follow to create a simple Clang plugin that prints "Hello World" when it is run:</p><ol><li><p>Create a new directory for your plugin and initialize it as a CMake project.</p></li><li><p>Install the Clang development libraries and headers. You will need these to build your plugin against the Clang libraries.</p></li><li><p>Create a new C++ source file for your plugin. This is where you will write the code for your plugin.</p></li><li><p>In the source file, include the Clang plugin headers and define a new class that inherits from the <code>clang::ASTConsumer</code> class. This class is the main entry point for your plugin, and it will be called by Clang at various points in the compilation process.</p></li><li><p>In the <code>clang::ASTConsumer</code> class, you will need to override the <code>HandleTranslationUnit</code> function. This function is called by Clang after the AST for the entire translation unit (i.e., the source code) has been constructed. Inside this function, you can use the Clang AST matchers to find specific nodes in the AST and do something with them, in this case, you can print "Hello World"</p></li><li><p>Create a new C++ source file for the <code>main</code> function of your plugin. This is where you will create an instance of your plugin class and register it with Clang.</p></li><li><p>In the main function, create an instance of your plugin class and register it with Clang using the <code>clang::registerASTConsumer</code> function.</p></li><li><p>Create a CMakeLists.txt file to build your plugin. Make sure to link against the Clang libraries and to build it as a shared library.</p></li><li><p>Build your plugin by running CMake and the build command.</p></li><li><p>You can now run Clang with your plugin by specifying the path to the shared library file.</p></li></ol><p>It's worth noting that this is just a basic example, and your plugin can do much more than just printing "Hello World". The Clang plugin API provides many functions and classes that you can use to analyze and modify the AST, as well as access other parts of the Clang compiler. Additionally, you may want to consult the Clang documentation for more information on how to use the Clang plugin API and for further examples.</p></div>
