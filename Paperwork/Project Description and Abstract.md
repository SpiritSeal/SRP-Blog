## Description
This project addresses the systemic vulnerabilities of modern, unrestricted, executable-based plugin frameworks with a focus on those that leverage or encourage 3rd party plugin manufacturers. The goals of this project are to build extendable proof-of-concepts that can identify existing abuses of the technology and prevent further exploitation in the future.
